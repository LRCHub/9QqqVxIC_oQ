[00:21.28] Always you're there with me when my real story moves on
[00:26.03] We will keep on fighting all the time starting now
[00:30.86] 何回だって失ったモノに立ち向かって
[00:35.57] 全部 消し去って思い出した
[00:40.51] There's nothing to change in me
[00:42.83] There's nothing to change in you
[00:45.38] What is the correct answer?
[00:47.49] 必ず
[00:49.59] 今 朽ち果てたさだめの中で闘いながら手に入れた
[00:59.32] 僕の命を捧げる日まで
[01:04.01] This is my only way
[01:08.09] このまま
[01:09.36] I will stay alive praying for myself
[01:18.93] I will stay alive praying for myself
[01:38.00] Someday I will only stop when you're completely gone
[01:42.81] Where do you then go and what are you looking for?
[01:47.62] 遠くなった未来の僕を追い越したくて
[01:52.34] 同じ色に染まり出した
[01:57.30] There's nothing to change in you
[01:59.64] There's nothing to change in me
[02:02.01] What is the correct answer?
[02:04.50] 一度は
[02:06.35] 儚く咲いた永遠の誓いが枯れ果てたまま泣いてる
[02:16.05] 蒼い欠片を集める日まで
[02:20.65] This is you and me now これから
[02:26.20] I will stay alive praying for myself
[02:35.68] I will stay alive praying for myself
[02:52.63] One day I just kept looking up to the sky
[02:55.09] What do you take and what do you lose again
[02:57.58] You know? You know? You know? I know!
[02:59.59] 'Cause I will need to protect someone now for sure, right?
[03:02.55] This decision needs to be made on today
[03:04.77] I've tried to imagine it over hundred times
[03:07.24] Nobody knows this story that I will put into an end and start it over again
[03:21.17] あの日の僕は何処か遠く知らない場所で目覚めた
[03:30.44] また思い出の中を探すの
[03:35.17] 「たった一つの命で」yeah
[03:41.55] 濡れた世界は僕一人だと思い続けていたから
[03:50.87] 僕のすべてを受け入れるなら
[03:55.45] 何千 何百 何十 何年だって
[04:01.72] 必ず道の先にあるから諦めないと決めたよ
[04:11.13] 最後の夢を叶える日まで
[04:15.85] This is my only way このまま
[04:21.13] I will stay alive praying for myself
[04:30.81] I will stay alive praying for myself
